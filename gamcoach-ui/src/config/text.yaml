      üëã Hello! We are a team of computer science researchers. Thank you so much
      for taking your time to help us improve our tool, GAM Coach.
    - >
      You might have heard that some banks üè¶ are using Artificial Intelligence
      (AI) to decide whether a person can or cannot get a loan. These banks ask
      for the loan applicant's information, such as <u>annual income</u>,
      <u>employment length</u>, and <u>credit score</u>. Then, the banks use AI
      programs to go through all collected information and decide on whether to
      approve or reject this client's loan application.
    - >
      Unfortunately, many people's loan applications are rejected by these
      programs. üôÅ Therefore, we are developing GAM Coach, an interactive
      coaching tool to <strong>help these rejected loan applicants succeed in
      their future applications!</strong> üí™ To do that, GAM Coach identifies an
      applicant's current weakness and provides simple and customizable
      strategies to get their next loan application approved.
    - >
      In this task, we want you to <strong>pretend to be a person whose loan
      application is rejected by a bank</strong>. The bank points you to GAM
      Coach to help you improve and succeed in future applications.

      Please try your best to imagine that you are a real user‚Äîusing GAM Coach
      to find the strategies that <strong>you think are useful</strong>. Our
      goal in this study is to learn what strategies would be helpful for real
      users and how GAM Coach can help.

      GAM Coach is a web-based interactive tool that helps users identify
      strategies to obtain a desirable AI decision (e.g., loan application
      approval). These strategies can be "if you increase your FICO score
      (credit score) by 3 points, and increase your credit utilization by 2.65%,
      you will get the loan." (figure below)
  after:
    - >
      In this scenario, you are a loan applicant whose application is rejected
      by a bank. The bank then gives you a link to GAM Coach to help you improve
      and succeed in the next application. GAM Coach is pre-loaded with all
      "information" you provided to the bank, e.g., <code>annual income</code>,
      <code>employment length</code>, <code>FICO score</code> (credit score).
      Each piece of the information is called a "feature". For example,
      <code>FICO score</code> is one feature, and it has your value
      <code>650</code>.
    - >
      GAM Coach uses all these features and values to compute best strategies
      that you can apply to get the next loan. In addition, you can tell GAM
      Coach what features are easier to change than others. For example, maybe
      it's easier for you to change your <code>FICO score</code> than changing
      <code>employment length</code>, and maybe you only want to change
      <code>FICO Score</code> in a certain range. As you can see, these strategy
      preferences vary from user to user, so GAM Coach allows you to specify
      <strong>your own preference</strong> and generate personalized strategies
      <strong>just for you.</strong>

    The main task in this HIT is to <strong>pretend to be a real user</strong>
    and use GAM Coach until you find a strategy (or strategies) that you are
    satisfied with. The strategy can be anything. It can be one of the first
    five initial strategies, or a follow-up strategy that meets your specified
    preference. <strong>There is no right answer</strong>, just use GAM Coach as
    you are a real loan applicant who hopes to find a good strategy to improve.
