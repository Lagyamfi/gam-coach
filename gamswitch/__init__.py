"""#What is GAM Switch?

GAM Switch is a simple and flexible algorithm to generate counterfactual (CF)
explanations for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).

In many machine learning (ML) applications, people use CF examples to help end
users learn about model decisions.
Given a data sample, a CF example is a similar example where the machine learning
model gives a different prediction.
Take loan application as an example, one can explain why a borrower's application
is rejected with a CF exampleâ€”"if your annual income were $5k higher, your application would
be approved."

GAM Switch is designed to generate CFs for [Explanable Boosting Machine
(EBM)](https://interpret.ml/docs/ebm.html), the state-of-the-art GAM trained with
boosting trees.
GAM Switch uses [mixed-integer linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming):
it can efficiently generates CFs are gauranteed to be optimal (minimal changes)
and sparse (use minimal features).

GAM Switch is flexible, where users can easily impose diverse constraints
for their target CFs. For example, one can tell GAM Switch to only generate CFs
that use certain features, within certain ranges.
GAM Switch supports both binary classification and regression problems.

# How to use GAM Switch?

To learn how to use GAM Switch, you can check out some example notebooks ([binary
classification](.), [regression](.)). The main functions you will use are
[`GAMSwitch()`](./gamswitch/gamswitch.html#GAMSwitch.__init__) and
[`generate_cfs()`](./gamswitch/gamswitch.html#GAMSwitch.generate_cfs)

```python
import numpy as np
#TODO
